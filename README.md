### 🛠️ Projects I've Built
I've developed several projects independently that are aimed at assisting medical professionals, including:

- 🩸**IoT-based Real-Time Heart Rate Monitor**. Real-time tracking with alerts for abnormal readings.  
- ☝🏻**IR-based Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Measurement**. Non-invasive prototype using infrared spectroscopy.
- 🫀**Digital Stethoscope**. Picks up heart and lung sounds digitally for analysis and also contains an earpiece output for analysis by medical professionals. 
- 🧠**Standalone Windows Application for Medical Image Analysis & Brain Tumor Detection**. A Windows app for brain tumor detection using ML and image processing. 

> All projects are built independently with a focus on real-world biomedical applications.
